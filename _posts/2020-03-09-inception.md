... almost 10 years in, and "Inception" is still incredible. A mixture of action and science-fiction, "Inception" continues to amaze. On the surface, the notion of dreams within dreams for corporate espionage (or the three layer nested dream, not counting limbo as the fourth, later in the film) would seem overly convoluted, but the film never gets too lost flipping through the various layers and the characters.

Watching it again this weekend, almost none of it seems outdated, and looks just as fresh as it was almost 10 years ago. On the special features of the blu-ray, many of the effects were not done on a green-screen, removing some of the tell-tale computer effects that ruined some of the Matrix films that looked a tad bit fake. The gravity-less rumble between Arthur and the projection was done on a [giant rotating set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PhiSSnaUKk). The film wouldn't have lasted long, however, if it lost the heart of the story: Cobb, his wife Mal, and his desire to return home. The film always comes back to Cobb. When Arthur and Ariadne went over some paradoxical architecture, a few lines are inserted regarding Mal's death. The only exception is the necessary branching of the storyline to establish Robert Fischer and the relationship with his father, but that subplot is still related to the overall thread of Cobb and his story.

Before I proceed further, I have to say that while the music may not become a classic, it is memorable. The track [528491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX7yOVVr_d0) struck just the right notes during the moment of catharsis between Fischer and his father. As Robert Fischer is entering the code to the safe to reveal the pinwheel, what sounds like a mixture of violins and some drums heighten the scene, until Eames activates the explosives and the music turns into this loud *BBBRRRRNNG* to emphasize the start of the dream's collapse.

It is left up to the viewer on if the spinning top stops at the end of the film, and the true nature of the relationship between Fischer and his father. Is Cobb dreaming when he finally arrives home and reunites with his children ? Was Fischer's father disappointed that his son couldn't live up to his expections, or disappointed because Fischer tried too hard to be like him? In some ways, it doesn't matter. Regardless of whether the reconciliation is "true" or not in both stories, we would prefer it to be true. It provides a peaceful closure of both stories that *feels* true though the film leaves it ambiguous. 

Christopher Nolan's upcoming film "Tenet" appears to revive a similar style of a science-fiction film encapsulated in the modern era. No flying dragons, monsters, or space-battles in the dreams of "Inception" and likely, "Tenet" probably won't be going back to the Civil War or the time of the dinosaurs. The IMAX prologue suggested something more grounded to the present time, and for me, the prologue of "Tenet" was far more exciting than the main feature film.
