If there is a classic out of the 1990's that might be uttered in the same breath as the classics of years past, one would might be "Jurassic Park". Released in 1993, it is almost 30 years old, yet it has spawned a series of sequels that continues to this day, including the upcoming "Jurassic World: Dominion" film.

Based on the book by Michael Crichton, a theme park has been created on a remote island with a unique set of attractions: actual, living dinosaurs. When a tour of the theme park goes wrong, chaos ensues. Cue the screams, the rampaging dinos, and [a lawyer being eaten while sitting on a toilet](https://youtu.be/VMzfrod7hcE).

The thrill is seeing the dinosaurs gracing the big screen and watching the heros escape from the more ferocious meat-consuming variety. Yet, I have found that there is more to like in "Jurassic Park". About a little less than half of the film is setup of the characters and the plot, before the dinos start rumbling around in the second half. Dr. Grant, most notably, has an arc who at first has a somewhat disdainful view of children, but ends up caring for Hammond's grandchildren when the dinosaurs are running loose. Also, the film sets up the tension effectively with the vibrating cups of water as the T-Rex stomps closer. I will also have to say that the mostly practical effects with the dinos seems to withstood the test of time, still looking good after all these years. 

The main reason though that I think "Jurassic Park" is more than just a "ancient-dinos-running-amok" movie is because it has been prescient for advances in science to come, and its warning. In a few short years after the book, and the film, [Dolly the sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_(sheep)) would be cloned. In the early 2000's, the beginnings of the [stem cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_controversy) debate would emerge. The warning in "Jurassic Park", about how "life finds a way" and man's hubris to tinker and control nature by resurrecting long-dead living creatures in the modern world is a lesson that I think that we are still learning now with the COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a microscopic virus, yet this creation of nature has become a force so powerful, it had literally halted human activity.
