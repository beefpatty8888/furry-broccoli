... it has been close to a year since I have moved into this city amidst the pandemic, and I'm happy to say that there is plenty of toilet paper. ðŸ§» Toilet paper at the grocery store, toilet paper at the 99 cent store, toilet paper at the pharmacy. There is also plenty of soap and liquid soap. ðŸ§¼ I've also been able to get haircuts.

Some say that [New York City is dead](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nyc-dead-forever-heres-why-james-altucher/). News stories of people leaving the city, or the big cities in general and fleeing to the suburbs or the rural areas. That isn't the New York City that I have seen. Sure, Broadway is shutdown. I don't remember the last time that I ate inside a restaurant, or went to a movie theater. Libraries are closed. Many shops and cultural sites were closed when the lockdown first began. Cost of living is still high in this city, and there is still the poop in the sidewalks, the homeless in the subways, and the lingering winter.

But there also continues to be a vibrancy to this city. I can hear the cries of children at a nearby school, the siren of a passing police car, the rumbling of the subways, the horns of impatient motorists and see the people walking outside from all walks of life. Some old, some young, and many in-between.

If New York City is dying, it is taking the advice of Dylan Thomas' poem ["Do not go gentle into that good night"](https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night), or for a more contemporary source, Phlotilla's song ["Going Down Fighting"](https://youtu.be/efZDxIswmBc):

> <p>If itâ€™s the end of the world</p>
> <p>Iâ€™m going down fighting</p>
> <p>With my finger on the trigger</p>
> <p>I know I gave it a shot</p>
> <p>If itâ€™s the end of it all</p>
> <p>God knows Iâ€™m trying</p>
> <p>Cause this world</p>
> <p>Is all that we got ...</p>
