- From the end credits of "Mrs. America", Season 1, Episode 1

... it is easy in politics to put voters in certain groups. There is the "soccer mom", or the "women's vote" or the "Latino vote." In the most recent election, such groupings turned out to be simplistic. Looking at the electoral map, [by county](https://www.wsj.com/election-results-2020/), some red states like Texas has pockets of blue. And some blue states, like New York, have pockets of red. Some places, like Arizona and Georgia, hasn't turned blue since the '90s, a generation (or two) ago.

"Mrs. America" is the story of women on both sides of the ERA debate. Some who were in favor and some who were against. There are tensions and conflict between the groups, and within the groups. The characters are bold, dynamic, in bright hues, each making "their own kind of music." The series does not claim full historical accuracy, and there is dramatic license. The vote for the ERA was before my time, and my recollections are from history lectures on "The Feminine Mystique" and the feminist movement. I have seen only the first couple of episodes, but relevant during this time and place, "Mrs. America" adds a new dimension on the current debates of sexism, and gender equality.
