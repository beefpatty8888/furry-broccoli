... of the works of John Singer Sargent, some of think of "Madame X", which [hangs at the MET](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/12127). Or, for a school-teacher that I once knew, maybe it is [The Daughters Of Edward Darley Boit](https://www.johnsingersargent.org/The-Daughters-Of-Edward-Darley-Boit.html). For me, it is the portrait of [Lady Agnew of Locknaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Agnew_of_Lochnaw) . Lounging on a chair, she is both relaxed, but yet also slightly inquisitive. "Quietly challanging" is the phrase used in the wikipedia article. Of course, she has long passed away, as well as the people who might have known her, but I sometimes wonder of her personality, and how close her portrait is to representing her true self.

"Portrait Of A Lady On Fire" is a romance, but I see it more as a story of friendship. As the two women know each other, the portrait of Heloise becomes more focused and more authentic to the true Heloise. In the second act of the film, their relationship becomes more intimate, which leads me to think that perhaps the most authentic portrait is the one that Marianne draws from memory, when the Heloise's dress briefly catches fire. "Portrait Of A Lady On Fire" can be considered to be something of a feminist film. There are scarcely any spoken lines by men, and the topic of abortion is bought up, in a discreet manner.

Parts of the film reminds me of Derek Tsang's "Soulmate" and other parts of Park Chan-Wook's "The Handmaiden". Perhaps the friendship between Marianne and Heloise that aligns with "Soulmate". And the intimate love story with "The Handmaiden". In any case, "Portrait Of A Lady On Fire" is a mesmerizing film, a story that unfolds slowly and gracefully, towards its final, fitting conclusion at an orchestral performance.
