... one of the earliest films that I remember watching at the theaters was "Honey, I Strunk the Kids." It was at one of the smaller, independent theaters. I don't even recall if I could hear all of the dialogue. Looking up the theater now, I don't think it exists anymore and may have been torn down.

"Cinema Paradiso" is a coming of age story, and a love letter to cinema. Released in 1988, "Cinema Paradiso" is an Italian film that chronicles a boy's friendship with the projectionist at a local movie house, the "Cinema Paradiso". The soundtrack composer was Ennio Morricone, who passed away earlier this month. One of the tracks have been embedded above. It is one of his more memorable works for me.

Theaters are still mostly closed due to the coronavirus concerns. Still [an article appeared](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/i-barely-breathed-tilda-swinton-emma-thompson-steve-mcqueen-and-more-on-their-most-memorable-moments) in "The Guardian" of people's fondest memories at the theater. Although I have watched a number of incredible films only after they were released to their home video or streaming formats, the theater is still the ideal way to enjoy a film. A few years ago, a theater had a marathon of David Lynch's "Twin Peaks". Two days of the TV show "Twin Peaks" back to back. While I didn't stay for all of it, it was a surreal experience to watch Twin Peaks in the wee hours with the rest of the audience.

I would not be surprised if many theaters are not able to recover from the coronavirus closures. In that sense, "Cinema Paradiso" may feel timely in more ways than one.
