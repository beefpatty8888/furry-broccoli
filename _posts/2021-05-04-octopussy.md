... the James Bond films has a long and storied history. "Octopussy", released in 1983, was the 13th of a series that is still going strong. With Roger Moore as James Bond, "Octopussy" was during the era of campier James Bond films, one line zingers, wisecracks and being slightly over-the-top. 

The tradition of the James Bond films usually involve exotic locations, beautiful women, James Bond wearing expensive-looking suits, and lots of stunts for the action sequences. Though the tone of James Bond has changed over the years, from the flirty, smooth Bond of Sean Connery and Roger Moore to the serious, tortured Bond of Daniel Craig, the overall formula hasn't changed much. The plot of "Octopussy" doesn't quite fit right; the plot changes half-way through from fake jewelry to an atomic bomb, but it doesn't really matter. "Octopussy" still has all the hallmarks of a classic Bond film.

I am generally forgiving of the James Bond films, since they all require some suspension of disbelief to begin with. Going into a James Bond film, there isn't any expectation that his life and adventures are anything close to the spy businesss in real life. There is some nosalgia in there too. The Roger Moore version of James Bond is the James Bond that I grew up watching, so his films are the ones that I think about as the "classic" James Bond films. The other parts of the James Bond mythology outside of the Roger Moore (and later eras) such as SPECTRE, or the cat-stroking Blofeld in the earlier Bond films feel disconnected from my memories of James Bond.

Years later, I was able to understand the sexual meaning in the title. Depending on who is asked, "Octopussy" may be ranked fairly high, or fairly low in the Bond films. There is a little bit of a lingering legacy of the film, however, when [Rita Coolidge's "All Time High"](https://youtu.be/bFurkDf6WXg) was referenced in the 2012 film, "Ted".
