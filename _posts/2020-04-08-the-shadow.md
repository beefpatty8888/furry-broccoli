> The price of redemption for Cranston was to take up man's struggle against evil. The Tulku taught him to cloud men's minds, to fog their vision through force of concentration, leaving visible the only thing he can never hide -- his Shadow. Thus armed, Cranston returned to his homeland, the most wretched lair of villainy we know as -- New York City

With the "shelter in place", stay-at-home orders, I've had a chance to revisit some older tv shows and movies that I haven't seen in a long while. A few episodes back in the Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the Deep Space Nine era (a post for another time perhaps) and a few of the older films like "Seven" or "Chungking Express."

One that I found myself revisiting is "The Shadow", the 1994 film that starred Alex Baldwin, and Penelope Ann Miller. Based on the crime-fighter from the radio and pulp magazines of the 1930's, "The Shadow" was the precursor of "Batman". By day, Lamont Cranston is well-to-do socialite, and by night, he transforms into a costumed superhero with a black overcoat, twin automatic pistols, and apparently in keeping with current CDC recommendations, he also wears a crimson scarf across his face. 

Although I have not read or heard the original "The Shadow" material from the radio broadcasts nor the pulp magazines, I have a feeling that the "The Shadow" movie recreates a similar feel of the original material, including some of the campiness. For example, there is the brief scene of a message traveling through an elaborate pipe system that apparently "The Shadow" and his network of agents has set up. There is also the rolling atomic bomb which is somewhat comical in its absurdity. As for Shiwan Khan's minions, it is left a mystery on how they had appeared seemingly out of nowhere. Some of the more mystical, science-fiction elements abilities of "The Shadow" such as the Force-like ability to cloud minds, and to hide in the darkness, actually works out rather well in the movie. The film adaptation doesn't take itself too seriously to remove all the exotic features, but also doesn't quite leave reality either. 

The cast includes a few that I didn't recognize until re-watching the film. Ian McKellen is the scientist, Reinhardt Lane, and Ethan Phillips, perhaps best known for his role as Neelix on Star Trek: Voyager, has a cameo as a museum guard. Although the character, Margo Lane, doesn't do much other than be Lamont Cranston's love interest and as a partial side-kick, Penelope Ann Miller looks the part of a fashionable 1930's gal.

"The Shadow" is one of those superheroes that don't get much attention these days. Like "The Spirit", "The Shadow" is best remembered as a historical pop culture figure. Although, if Christopher Nolan can remake Batman into a serious caped crusader hero, "The Shadow" can probably be remade into the contemporary setting as well. The 1930's recreation of New York City in the 1994 film enhances the story in my opinion, but "The Shadow" still looks cool whether in the 1930's or in the 2020's.
