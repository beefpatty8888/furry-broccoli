... of the recent military submarine films, "The Hunt For Red October" probably stands out as the best. "Crimson Tide" with Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington has its moments, so does "Hunter Killer" with Gerald Butler and "K-19: The Widowmaker" with Harrison Ford. None of these, in my own opinion, surpasses "The Hunt For Red October".

First, there are the cameos by James Earl Jones, aka Darth Vader. That alone brings it up a notch. And an appearance of the real-life USS Enterprise aircraft carrier. Then there is the usage of a sonar ping, the sound of which was [dramatized](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64931/14-deep-facts-about-hunt-red-october) for this film. The real reason, however, why "The Hunt For Red October" stands above the rest is there is an element of intelligence. An action, drama film that isn't completely mindless. Actual tactics and strategies appear to be incorporated into the hunt for the submarine.

A measure of re-watchability, is that the movie still retains a freshness even with subsequent viewings, and I have found this to be the case in "The Hunt For Red October". Some of it is dated as the film was released in 1990. The torpedo effects are not as good and there are the aviator glasses that were in fashion back then. And, the geo-political situation is different now. But, watching it again now, it is still exciting, and I understand it more than when I first saw the film way back when.

If you, the reader, happen to decide to see this film, I would caution against the versions on television that have been edited for content. Some scenes may be removed that could provide some additional context to the film. One scene that I think is commonly edited out is when Ramius kills the political officer, which just confuses the viewer on what actually happened to the political officer because that scene is cut out. Instead, I would suggest to purchase the theatrical versions of the film.

Lastly, a mention on the recently departed Sean Connery. Many knew him from his James Bond days, although I didn't know him until much later. Probably the first movie that I saw him in was "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" in which he had a brief cameo. Then, "The Rock" along with Ed Harris. Sean Connery is in top form in "The Hunt For Red October", speaking some Russian and with enough caginess as Ramius to keep the viewer guessing on his real intentions for the "Red October" submarine.
