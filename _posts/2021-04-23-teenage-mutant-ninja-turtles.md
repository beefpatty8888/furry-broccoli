... anyone who grew up during the '80s and early '90s probably knew of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon. It was right up there with Transformers, GI Joe and maybe Darkwing Duck. The live-action film, released in 1990, and based on the cartoon, is a cult-classic in its own way. 

Admittedly, a few things of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the film, hasn't dated well. Some of the slang and wisecracks that may have been popular during the '80s and '90s don't cross over into the 21st century. The "Foot clan" sounds remarkably cheesy. Shredder still looks evil though, and the turtle costumes still hold up. The script is also a bit more clever than I remember, probably because I now understand some of the passing references to the
"Grapes of Wrath" and "War and Peace". Back then, I was just watching the turtles kicking butt.

Although the 1990 film doesn't take itself too seriously - it is, after all, about some talking, kung-fu fighting turtles that love pizza - the first film is probably the best of the original trilogy. Splinter's wise and patient demeanor, and Raphael's temper show some effort into character development. It doesn't go too far into the science-fiction category to lose sense of realism. It is still a fun movie to watch, perhaps more so for the nosalgia.
