... I came about re-watching this film recently in a roundabout way. The song above "Vide Cor Meum" was made specifically for the film "Hannibal", the sequel to "Silence of the Lambs". Reading the trivia, it also turns out that the song is also used in "Kingdom of Heaven." 

Watching the film again, "Kingdom of Heaven" is still a fantastic movie about 15 years after its initial release. Ridley Scott appears in a brief introduction to the director's cut, acknowledging that some might feel that the director's version of "Kingdom of Heaven" might be too long, and while 3 hours or so is longer than the usual film, the film itself never "feels" like the pacing was lost. Instead the additional scenes, such as the subplot regarding Sybilla's son, Baldwin V, doesn't linger too long, but yet also not overlooking the importance of the character and his impact on his mother, Sybilla.

"Kingdom of Heaven" is, on the surface, a film about a time during the Crusades and the city of Jerusalem, although it is probably more directed to the heightened awareness of the Middle East following September 11th. Jerusalem takes on an idealized form in "Kingdom of Heaven", first as a place of new beginnings. A place where Balian can erase his sins. It becomes an idea, a place where Jewish followers, Christians and Muslims live in harmony. A "kingdom of conscience" according to King Baldwin IV, the "Leper King". There are a few hints in the film of Jerusalem's importance. Balian visits the site where Jesus was crucified. The Temple Mount looms in the background in a few shots of the city. Though not heavy-handed, there is dialogue that mention Jerusalem as a center of conflict. During the negotiations between Balian and Saladin, Balian says 

> <p>"Before I lose it [Jerusalem], I will burn it to the ground. Your holy places. Ours. Every last thing in Jerusalem that drives men mad."</p>

That comment, while probably could have been applicable during the siege of Jerusalem in approximately 1187, could also have applied in 2005 when the film was made.

There was some sacrifice of [historical accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Heaven_(film)#Historical_accuracy) in this fictional, dramatic account. Of note that [King Baldwin IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_IV_of_Jerusalem), the Leper King, wasn't the peacemaker that was shown on screen. In the special features of the Director's Cut DVD, it is mentioned that much of the inspiration for the costume design came from later artistic depictions of the Crusades so the costumes themselves may not be steadfastly accurate to the time. However, on a personal note, I am somewhat willing to let some of the historical accuracy go to tell a good story. My own impressions of knights and knighthood also stem from the later, artistic depictions such as the paintings of John Waterhouse of the Arthurian legend, or the paintings of Edmund Leighton, whose most famous work is "The Accolade" of a young man being knighted by a Queen. I also couldn't help but feel some giddiness while watching the trebuchets in action during the Siege of Jerusalem.
