title: Armageddon

... what stands out in the film is the repeating screaming. Sure, there is the slightly nauseous use of the low angle moving camera, and the over-used light flares, but I am going to remember most all of the death screams. Did any of the actors find their voice getting hoarse after the 15th take of the death scream ?

> Michael Bay: "You are about to die, and you are letting out your final scream."
> Random dude about to die: "aaahhhhh"
> Bay: "Louder! This is your moment, your cri de coeur. You are crying out from heart. You see your death coming, and you just can't bear it. You can't hold it. You are screaming for your life!"
> Random dude: "AAAAAAHHHHHH*cough**cough**wheeze*aaaaahhhh. Crap, I should have stopped smoking."

Michael Bay's films are known for being over the top. In "Dark of the Moon", Chicago gets destroyed. It doesn't get exciting when meteors strike the middle of nowhere in Nebraska or North Dakota, so instead, New York City, Shanghai and Paris get hit in Armageddon. To the save the world, a group of oil-drillers meet up with a somewhat half-crazed Russian cosmonaut to blow up the astroid and save the world. Cue lots of drama, wisecracks, explosions and final death screams.

No doubt, there is a lot of beat up on with this film. Both shuttles probably sustained damage to the heat shields during the Mir explosion and the landing attempts on the astroid, and yet, one of the space shuttles has no problem returning back to Earth ? Heat shield damage is what caused the Columbia disaster, yes ? So ... how is the shuttle in the movie able to return back to Earth ? And then there is Grace Stamper, the daughter, who has an inconsistent personality. At different points, she is passive and lethargic, but in other points, in your face. And, there is the excessive use of flying helicopters. Any opportunity for a few helicopters to appear, helicopters was flown about, just to have helicopters fly about in the scene somewhere.

Still, I have to say that the launch sequence was exciting, and some of the wisecracks were funny. It doesn't really matter that the rocket booster and external tank separation sequence are incorrect. And there seems to be a slight issue with the editing in which Houston is supposed to have control of the mission only after the shuttles have cleared the tower. Yet, the launch just looks cool. The bright, hot gas contrasting with the night sky, and Liv Tyler striking a pose, looking sexy with a nice soft breeze on her hair. "Armageddon" may be most remembered for the ensemble cast of up-and-coming actors and actresses. Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Luke Wilson, Jason Issacs, the late Michael Clarke Duncan .
