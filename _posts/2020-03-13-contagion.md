... I was going to place a comparison between the COVID-19 virus (the "coronavirus") and the fictional virus in this movie (MEV-1) after a critique of the film itself, but I decided to switch it around and place a critique of the film last, and address a viral comparison first. I should mention that I am not a medical expert, so I may be incorrect with the facts.

From the descriptions in the movie, the fictional MEV-1 virus had the following charactistics: it can be transmitted via touch, has approximately an R0 of about 2, later increased to 4. R0,R-nought, is the reproduction number that signifies the rate of transmission of the virus. A R0 of 2 means that for every 1 person infected, 2 others will also become infected. MEV-1 is also described in the movie to attack the nervous system and has a mortality rate of about 25-30%. 

In contrast, COVID-19 isn't transmitted via direct contact, but can be transmitted via droplets from coughs and sneezes. COVID-19 also has a R0 of about 2, but instead of attacking the nervous system, COVID-19 affects the respiratory system. Most importantly, the mortality of COVID-19 is much lower at approximately 3%, though data is still somewhat preliminary. COVID-19's close relative, the [common flu](https://www.livescience.com/new-coronavirus-compare-with-flu.html), has a mortality rate of .1% and a R0 of about 1.3. COVID-19 shares the R0 value as the fictional MEV-1, but not the mortality rate, and affects different parts of the body. However, COVID-19 is also more contagious and lethal than the common flu. In a [comparison](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-diseases-comparing-covid-19-sars-mers-numbers-n1150321) between COVID-19, SARS and MERS, the fictional MEV-1 in the movie, partly inspired by the actual Nipah virus, would have the lethality of MERS, but also the reproduction number closer to COVID-19. 

Not to diminish the seriousness, COVID-19 is basically more contagious (with the exception of the fictional MEV-1 in the film), but less lethal than SARS, MERS and MEV-1.

As for the film itself, it mirrors the present day. Certain scenes and dialogue containing face mask imagery, mentions of hand-washing, face-touching and including phrases like "social distancing" and "R0" in the film are very similar to the scenes and wording in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The quarantine of Chicago and parts of Minnesota in the film, has its counterparts with the containment area of New Rochelle, New York, and the lockdown in Wuhan, China. Thus far, there has not been a need for ration packs, or any reports yet of mass rioting and violence, but there are heavier than usual crowds at the local grocery. Apparently, there has been a run at the local retailers for [toilet paper](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/health/toilet-paper-shortages-novel-coronavirus-trnd/index.html), although I should emphasize that there is no information that toilet paper is going to help prevent contracting the virus or assist if you do get it. COVID-19, thus far, is not known to cause diarrhea or other problems with the digestional tract. If you have diarrhea, it probably isn't the coronavirus. You probably just ate expired or under cooked food.

The film is an ensemble piece. It doesn't develop any particular character for the audience to be emotionally attached, but doesn't lessen the gravity and seriousness of the situation as the crisis worsens. A few characters are worth mentioning in the context of the current COVID-19 situation. Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) represents the doctors and medical professionals on the front-line of any viral outbreak, many of whom [contract the virus themselves](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html). There is also the blogger, Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law), peddling the snake oil "Forsythia" as the cure. In the weeks ahead as we approach the peak of the COVID-19 virus, there will be lots of inaccurate information, some of which is driven by panic, rumor and speculation, and others with more deliberate [malicious intentions](https://thecyberwire.com/newsletters/daily-briefing/9/50). The music in the film is understated, mostly used just to heighten the tension at some scenes, but often absent. There are no epic orchestrals or chorus vocals, and its diluted nature fits in well to set the tone of the subject matter.

Contagion has been mentioned as being mostly scientifically accurate, but while watching the film, keep in mind that COVID-19 is not the same virus that is in the movie. There is some exaggeration for dramatic effect, but for the most part, it is a film that is timely and relevant.
