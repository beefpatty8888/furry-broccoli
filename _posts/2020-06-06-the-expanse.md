Much of science fiction has been about analogies to present conditions. "Star Trek" is the most famous example - a black woman as the communications officer, an Asian as the helmsman, and a Russian as a navigator. In the 1960's, such as cast was ahead of its time, particularly with a Russian, and a black woman.

"The Expanse" similarly has analogies to past and current strifes.  A cold war between Earth and Mars. A resentful Belt that distrusts and hates both. "The Expanse" takes its cues from previous science fiction classics of Blade Runner, some of Babylon 5, Stargate and Battlestar Galactica.

Notably, there are no strange looking aliens, unless the hybrids are counted, on "The Expanse" which makes the analogies more direct. However, the universe in "The Expanse" is just as broad and immersive. The Belters have their own language; "bosmang" is probably the equivalent of "Yes boss" or "Yes, sir." The humans on Mars dream of a terraformed surface to be capable of sustaining plant life. And Earth with its aging fleet.

The first season and part of the second season of "The Expanse" is probably its strongest. A detective is assigned the task to track down a missing young woman, and a conspiracy is afoot that threatens to turn the cold war into a kinetic conflict. In the middle, is a discovery of a mysterious proto-molecule, the purpose of which is unknown. Science-fiction noir is somewhat a unique genre. The only time that it was really successful was probably Blade Runner, but aside from that, noir still harkens back to the 1940's or 1950's. Once in while, in the case of neo-noir, it may occur in the present. Science fiction noir, however, is rare, and Detective Miller's quest to track down Julie Mao is one of the highlights of the first season, and part of the second, of "The Expanse."

Once the arc of Detective Miller and Julie Mao completes, "The Expanse" looses the noir aspects. The war between Earth and Mars becomes active while the saga of the proto-molecule continues. The proto-molecule is something of a MacGuffin, similar to the proto-culture in the Robotech saga. The proto-molecule has an agenda of its own, which is somewhat revealed in the end of season 3, but it mainly serves as a means to expand on the tensions and intrigue between Earth, Mars and the Belters, or themes of the human condition such as faith, family, violence, and redemption.

The series has been able to attract a number of heavy-hitters, including David Strathairn. While the crew of the "Rocinante" has settled upon a regular cast by season 2, there is a number of supporting characters that comes and goes. Prax, on the search for his missing child, is a temporary crewmember on the "Rocinante" as well as Bobbie Draper, the Martian marine. The character of Detective Miller mostly disappears once the arc completes regarding Julie Mao, though he appears on and off in an altered form later in season 3.
