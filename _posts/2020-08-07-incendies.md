title: "Incendies"

... in a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Ub_K3ObB0) with the director, Denis Villeneuve described the story of the film as a "Greek tragedy". "Incendies" is, at the very least, heartbreaking. And shocking in its own way. There are no light-hearted moments in this rather serious dramatic film, aside from one minor, understated moment of levity.

"Incendies" is a French-Canadian film, with scenes in the Middle East. French and Arabic are spoken, sometimes in the same scene. Once in a while, an English phrase slips through. Some years ago, I might have been able to speak about the Middle East with some understanding, but these days, while I still know some of the basics of the region, I no longer know the details. However, in that same video, Denis Villeneuve did mention that the Middle Eastern country in "Incendies" is fictitious. [Some have concluded](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255953/trivia?item=tr2506198), nevertheless, that the closest parallel is probably Lebanon which had a devastating civil war from around 1975 to 1990.

Without spoiling the events of the film, it is left unsaid on the impact of the discovery of the past on the twins. Are they better off, more free, or has the past become a burden and a darkness ? The final letter from the mother hopes that the knowledge of the past becomes a way to move on from the violence, but some may ask if it is better not to known the past at all.

I re-watched this film partly because of Denis Villeneuve. I recently saw "Arrival" once again, and in the included extras, Ted Chiang, the author of the original short story "Story of Your Life", mentioned that "Incendies" was one of the reasons that he had approved of Denis Villeneuve as the director of the film based on the story. Denis Villeneuve is perhaps best known for "Sicario" or "Blade Runner 2049" and I am looking forward to his upcoming "Dune" adaptation.
