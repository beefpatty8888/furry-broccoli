... these days, inter-racial relationships don't raise much eyebrows. Inter-racial marriages are still a minority, about [10%](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/07/interracial-marriages.html), but about 80% of Americans approve of inter-racial marriages, according to this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage_in_the_United_States). Back in the late 1960's however, things were much different. The landmark case, [Loving v. Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) was just decided a few months prior, but inter-racial relationships, and inter-racial marriages, still faced substantial cultural obstacles when "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" was released in 1967.

The plot of "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" is a simple one. The couple lands in San Francisco to meet the parents of the young woman. Taking place mostly indoors, the story unfolds as the parents, and the couple, struggle to adjust to realities of being from different races. The parents of the young man arrive in San Francisco as well, adding further drama and perspective. It is important to note that resistance to the mixed-race couple isn't just the daughter's father, who is white, but also from some the black characters as well: Tillie, the black housekeeper, and the young man's father, Mr. Prentice.

"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" works well mostly due to the seasoned actors and actresses in the cast. The legends of Katharine Hepburn (unrelated to Audrey Hepburn), Spencer Tracy, and Sidney Poitier adds a natural ease to the film. I am dating myself, generationally speaking, but I'll have to admit that this is probably the first film that I have seen with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.
