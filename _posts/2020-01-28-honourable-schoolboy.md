> <p>"In terms of eligibility, Chief," he goes on quietly, "from an operational standpoint, we on the China side of your house would regard this as one of the key positions in the whole of the Chinese administration. If we could pick ourselves one slot for an agent inside the mainland, Nelson's might be the one."</p>  
> <p>"Reasons ?" Smiley enquires, still alternating between his jottings and the open folder before him.</p>  
>  "The Chinese navy is still in the Stone Age. We do have a formal interest in Chinese technical intelligence, naturally, but our real priorities - like those of Moscow, no doubt - are strategic and political. Beyond that, Nelson could supply us with the total capacity of all Chinese shipyards. Beyond that again, he could tell us the Chinese submarine potential, which has been frightening the daylights out of the Cousins for years. And of ourselves too, I might add, off and on."  
> "So think what it's doing for Moscow," an old burrower murmurs out of turn.  
> "The Chinese are supposedly developing their own version of the Russian G-2 class submarine," di Salis explains. "No one knows a lot about it. Have they their own design? Have they two or four tubes? Are they armed with sea-to-air missiles or sea-to-sea? What is the financial appropriation for them? There's talk of a Han class. We had word they laid one down in 'seventy-one. We've never had confirmation. In Dairen in 'sixty-four, they allegedly built a G class armed with ballistic missiles but it still hasn't been officially sighted. And so forth and so on," he says deprecatingly, for, like most of the Circus, he has a rooted dislike of military matters and would prefer the more artistic targets.  
> "For hard and fast detail on these subjects the Cousins would pay a fortune," di Salis says. "In a couple of years, Langley could spend hundreds of millions in research, over-flights, satellites, listening devices, and God knows what - and still not come up with an answer half as good as one photograph. So if Nelson -" He let the sentence hang, which is somehow a lot more effective than making it finite.  
> Connie whispers, "Well done, Doc," but still for a while nobody else speaks; they are held by Smiley's jotting, and his continued examination of the folder.  
> "Good as Haydon," Guillam mutters. "Better. China's the last frontier. Toughtest nut in the trade."
